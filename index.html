            <p class="para-2">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="para-1">History of Education</p>
            <p class="para-2">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[6]</p>

            <p class="para-1">Educate with Us</p>
            <p class="para-2">A survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools (LCPS) found that
                over a five-year period ending in July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All (EFA)
                objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.[66] The polarization was
                due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups,
                provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report
                examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.[66] Surveys
                suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. </p>
